    "There can be 4 steps to check whether a statement is subjective or objective. \n",
    " - Step 1: Whether the statement expresses a feeling or emotion or very personal opinion toward something. If so, the statement is subjective. Note that very personal opinion can later be proved as objective but the expression may intend to be subjective. If not, please refer to Step 2. \n",
    " - Step 2: Whether the statement can be checked against a fact. If so, please refer to Step 2-a and 2-b. If not or if the fact check returns many conflicting observations and no conclusions, please refer to Step 3. \n",
    "     - Step 2-a: If the check result is a pass, then the statement is objective. \n",
    "     - Step 2-b: If the check result is negative, then the statement is subjective. \n",
    " - Step 3: If a large percent (maybe >= 80%) of people around the world can agree on it, the statement is likely to be objective. Otherwise, it is more likely to be subjective.\n",
    " - Step 4: (Special Note) The steps above may not be applicable to interpretation of iterary expressions containing metaphors and allegories. Or if must be applied, the steps may need to shift the results more toward subjectivity."
